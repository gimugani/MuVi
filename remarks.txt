Credit:

I should mention that I borrowed many parts from sndpeek by Ge Wang and Perry Cook, 
and that I also received help by looking at source code of Diana by Uri Nieto. 
The libraries, including chuck_fft, RtAudio, Stk, Thread are all borrowed from sndpeek 
and not written by me. 

The hardest part of this project was therefore to understand the source code of sndpeek and Diana
and modify it in a way that I want. Therefore, I was fortunate that I had all the framework
for the project, and the only job left for me was to come up with new graphics using openGL. 
I had to learn the basic syntax and how to draw simple objects with openGL. 

If I had more time, I would have created more visual effects, making them more artistic as well. 
I really enjoyed the project. I had struggles since I couldn't put together the parts that I needed. 
But once I had it working, I couldn't stop myself changing and adding more features to it.
