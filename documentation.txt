How to configure on Unix system:
MuVi should compile by typing: 

make

in the terminal. Even though there may be lots of error messages regarding
rtAudio being deprecated, it wouldn't affect any performance of the program. 
If for any reason, the program does not compile and it asks for object file 
for MuVi (i.e. MuVi.o), typing the following will create it:

gcc -D __MACOSX_CORE__ -o MuVi.cpp 

Then, typing make should compile the program. 

How to run: 
The program does not take any command line argument. Therefore, 
simply typing the name of program will successfully run it. 
It takes sound input from the microphone and visualize the sound
in different frequency bands accordingly. There are two different modes of
visual effects : Frequency Bar & Circle. Pressing 'c' while the program is
running will switch on/off Circle Mode. 

Misc.:
The program takes sound input and puts into a buffer size of 1024. 
By only taking real values of FFT, which is half the buffer size, 
different color represents different frequency ranges stored in the buffer.
Since it performs in real-time, it is more interesting to see the 
visualization with an actual piece of music playing along. 
In Circle Mode, the coordinates for each circle are randomized
using rand() function. Therefore, their movement across the window does not
necessarily sync with the beat of the music. However, circles do interact
with the music by expanding themselves.
